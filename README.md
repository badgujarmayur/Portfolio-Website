"I developed a portfolio website from June to July 2024 using Django and Python. The goal was to create a platform to showcase my personal projects, skills, and professional experience. Django was used as the backend framework to handle dynamic content, such as managing and displaying different projects and sections of my portfolio.

The frontend of the website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring the site was interactive and responsive. This means that the web pages adjust seamlessly across various devices like computers and smartphones, providing a smooth user experience.

I used Django's templating system to dynamically load content, so whenever I need to update or add new projects, I can do so easily without altering the core structure of the website. Django's structure also allowed me to efficiently manage forms, such as a contact form, enabling visitors to get in touch with me.
